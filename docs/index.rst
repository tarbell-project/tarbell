===================

The Tarbell template uses Python Flask and Google Spreadsheets to create

filesystem.

Tarbell is named after Ida Tarbell, a distinguished muckraking journalist whose
1904 The History of the Standard Oil Company is a masterpiece of investigative
reporting. `Read more about her on Wikipedia
