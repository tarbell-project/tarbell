##### Background
Tarbell is a web publishing platform with which users can easily produce websites.  It is simple, lightweight, and fairly quick to pick up; however, there remains much room for improvement.  It is currently being developed by the Chicago Tribune News Applications Team.  Our team has already made contact with their lead developer, and he has suggested ways we can provide useful contributions to their project.  
As the project currently stands right now, Tarbell has some considerable strengths that drew our interest.  Through the utilization of Google spreadsheets and Amazon S3, publishing is made easy.  This kind of content management makes editing existing content smooth and consistent.  Once you setup your project with Tarbell, you will have created a Google spreadsheet with which to work.  You can simply open this spreadsheet in a browser and edit the content of your website.  In this way, your data is easily accessible, enabling you to make your desired changes once your website is up and running.
Another cool thing about Tarbell is how Bootstrap has been incorporated into the packaged code.  This gives users access to the basic foundation that Bootstrap provides for future websites in regard to CSS stylings and JavaScript functionality.  In addition to this, you are free to edit the existing templates to your liking in order to fully customize your website.  Bootstrap is a great resource to get started with a website, and it is incredibly beneficial that it has been incorporated into Tarbell.  
Ultimately, Tarbell is a user friendly service that is excellent for users who are looking to create and publish their own websites.  It utilizes some very helpful tools, namely Google spreadsheets and Twitter Bootstrap, in a way that increases the ease and functionality of making your own website with Tarbell.  

##### Statement of Work
Despite its strengths, Tarbell is designed for a slightly more advanced user base in terms of their basic programming knowledge.  While the documentation on how to get started with Tarbell is very strong, there comes with it a basic understanding of Git and the command line that might prevent some users from choosing Tarbell to construct their websites.  There is one major advancement that could heavily contribute to the accessibility of Tarbell: a web interface.  Through our contributions, our team will take on this task in an effort to provide Tarbell with a functional browser based interface through which users can easily get started crafting their websites.

##### Communication
What makes this project so cool is that we have the opportunity to work directly with the developers.  Of course with any open source project hosted on GitHub, there is always potential for online collaboration; however, we are fortunate enough to be working on a project that is not only accessible on GitHub, but the lead developers are located locally in the Chicago area, too.  This greatly increases the opportunity for us to communicate with them.  We are working to create a web interface after communicating with their head developer.  This means that we are really able to benefit from communicating with them regularly since we can talk with them to know exactly what they are looking for. 
Furthermore, this leaves ample room for feedback on their end.  If we produce something that they have requested, then we can show it to them and hear what they have to say about it.  If there is something that they like about it, then we’ll know to construct something similar in the future.  Similarly, if there is room for improvement, then we can use their direct feedback to make adjustments.  As such, it is an imperative component of our project to foster effective communication in order to make useful contributions to this open source project.

##### Functionality
The first area of interest that we would like to focus on for this project is functionality.  Our goal is to create a functional web interface for users to craft their own websites through Tarbell.  We will start by transferring the existing local Tarbell interface to a browser.  We simply want to have an interface in which users can produce a basic website as our first goal.  
From there, we will build on the advanced tools that Tarbell offers.  For instance, we will incorporate the various templates offered through this platform, such as basic portfolio layout, map-based layout, and video-based layout,  in a web environment.  This will provide users with a simple visual when choosing where to start with their website. In addition to this, we would like to build on the design customization provided by Bootstrap.  We want users to be able to fully benefit from the stylesheets offered by this framework, so our goal here is to make this a fun and simple component of our Tarbell web interface.  
If time permits, we would like to perhaps add further functionality to our web interface.  This is yet to be determined, as it requires further conversation with the developers over at the Chicago Tribune; however, we will be in contact with these individuals throughout the scope of our project, so we will surely reach this point shortly.  For the purposes of this proposal, these enhancements are TBD.  

##### Design
The second aspect of our web interface that we would like to emphasize is the design.  We want to create a web interface that is just as visually appealing as the websites that Tarbell helps produce.  This means that we wish to place just as much of an emphasis on the design of our web interface as the functionality behind it.  It is important to have an interface that users want to work with.  In order to accomplish this, we will largely rely on CSS, JavaScript, and other tools that we find useful.
This, too, will require a decent amount of communication between our team and the Chicago Tribune News Applications Team.  We are, after all, working on a product that they will most certainly use.  It is likely that this will become a sort of trial and error process.  As it stands, we would like to be able to put a substantial effort into both the functionality and design of our web interface; however, this is subject to change due to the scope of our project.  

##### Timeline
The following timeline is simply tentative to provide some sense of direction with our workflow over the next four weeks:
